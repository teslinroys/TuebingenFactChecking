# Approaches for Subtask A
- Simple logistic regression or SVM as a basis
- Use of patterns to improve precision of fact vs non-fact estimation as suggested by Oraby et. al

# Approaches for Subtask B (truth estimation)
- Simple features: number of users with the same answer, answers containing links, answer length
- Link checking: does the linked resource contain the answer given?
- Online (or stored) search queries: presence of terms in answer in top results for question keyword search
- Pre-search domain-specific data (e.g. Qatar regulation docs) before widening net to online search
- Persistent user modelling: does a user often give false answers?
